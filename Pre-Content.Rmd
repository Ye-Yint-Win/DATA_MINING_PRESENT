# Neural Net....

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When we say Neural Net... what comes to mind...?

Before we begin explaining what Neural nets are...

![](images/Exampleu.jpg)

Typoglycemia : The phenomenon it describes, known as typoglycemia, is
the ability to understand words when the first and last letters are
stable, but the intermediate letters are scrambled.

Our brain naturally finds pattern in everyday
life...![](images/Example2.avif)

Now lets everyone's own experience...take charge...

![](images/duck-rabbit.avif)

What do you see..?

Our brains are naturally looking for patterns...

What determines what you see... depends on you...

Your experiences ..

Your neurons...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## That is the idea behind Neural Networks

Neural Nets- AI Learning modeled inspired by the structure and functions
of a brain with its working Neurons.
1)It consists of interconnected nodes organized into layers, including an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer
2)learn to recognize patterns and relationships in data, adjusting their internal parameters (weights and biases) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual outputs
3)based on the patterns learned during training, making them powerful tools for tasks such as image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics

Each neuron receives input signals from the the previous layer, applies a transformation to these inputs using 
weights and biases

forwardfeeding : the propagation of input data through the network, layer by layer

***Example of forwardfeeding***

$$f(x)= \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_kh_k(X)$$

$$f(x)= \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_kg(w_{k0} + \sum_{j=1}^{p} w_{kj} X_j$$

The equation you provided appears to be a linear regression model,
where:-

$$f(x) $$ represents the predicted outcome.

$$\beta_0$$ is the intercept term

$$\beta_k$$ are the coefficients associated with each predictor variable

$$g()$$ represents some function applied to its argument.

$$w_{k0}$$ and $$w_{kj}$$ are weights associated with each predictor
variable.

$$X_j$$ are the predictor variables.

$$K$$ is the total number of predictor variables.

$$p$$ is the total number of predictors.In this model, each predictor
variable

Activations within the equation begin to model relationships within the
data...

-the activations, often denoted by the function $g()$, introduce
non-linearities that allow the model to capture complex relationships
between the predictor variables and the outcome.

$$A_k = h_k(X) $$

$$A_k = h_k(X) = g(w_{k0} + \sum_{j=1}^{p}w_{kj}X_j$$

$$h_k(X)=g(z) $$

$$f(x)= \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_kA_k$$

Weights put on each neruon changes the combination of the output.

## [**Activations**]{.underline} 

## Introduces nonlinear , allowing networks to model relationships in data...

-Determines whether to activate neuron...

-Influence output signal that is "propagated forward"... based off its
weight put with it, or as we know ...Experiences

## [Sigmoid]{.underline} 

## logistic function -Used for binary classifications tasks -Maps the input value to a range between 0 and 1

## [ReLU]{.underline} - Another Activation Function

\- Rectified Linear Unit -One of the Activations models that could be
used...
-introduces non-linearity by outputting zero for negative input values and leaving positive values unchanged, promoting faster training

CNN - Convolutional Neural Network 
Are a class of deep learning models designed specifically for processing structured grid data, such as images

1)Cars
a)analyze camera feeds in real-time and identify various objects on the road, such as pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs. 

2)Security
a)analyze live video streams from surveillance cameras and detect anomalies or suspicious activities in real-time
