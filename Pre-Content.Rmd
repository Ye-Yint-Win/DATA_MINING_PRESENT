# Neural Net....

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## When we say Neural Net... what comes to mind...?

Before we begin explaining what Neural nets are...

![](images/Exampleu.jpg)

Typoglycemia : The phenomenon it describes, known as typoglycemia, is
the ability to understand words when the first and last letters are
stable, but the intermediate letters are scrambled.

Our brain naturally finds pattern in everyday
life...![](images/Example2.avif)

Now lets everyone's own experience...take charge...

What do you see..?

Our brains are naturally looking for patterns...

What determines what you see... depends on you...

Your experiences ..

Your neurons...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## That is the idea behind Neural Networks

Neural Nets- AI Learning modeled inspired by the structure and functions
of a brain with its working Neurons.x

***Example of forwardfeeding***

$$f(x)= \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_kh_k(X)$$

$$f(x)= \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_kg(w_{k0} + \sum_{j=1}^{p} w_{kj} X_j$$

Activations within the equation begin to model relationships within the
data...

\-

$$A_k = h_k(X) $$

$$A_k = h_k(X) = g(w_{k0} + \sum_{j=1}^{p}w_{kj}X_j$$

$$h_k(X)=g(z) $$

$$f(x)= \beta_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{K}\beta_kA_k$$

Weights put on each neruon changes the combination of the output.

# [**Single Neural Net:**]{.underline}

## [**Activations**]{.underline} 

## Introduces nonlinear , allowing networks to model relationships in data...

-Determines whether to activate neuron...

-Influence output signal that is "propagated forward"... based off its
weight put with it, or as we know ...Experiences

## [Sigmoid]{.underline} 

## logistic function -Used for binary classifications tasks -Maps the input value to a range between 0 and 1

## [ReLU]{.underline}

\- Rectified Linear Unit -One of the ACtivations models that could be
used...
